## How to run the product

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run (while in A2):
```
mvn clean install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

## Running The Product

### Without Make

To generate the square mesh, enter this into the terminal. 

```
cd generator
java -jar generator.jar -m square -o sample.mesh
```

Then go to the visualizer directory.
```
cd visualizer
java -jar visualizer.jar -m ../generator/sample.mesh -o sample.svg
```
To activate debug mode, add `-X` to the end of the command line during the visualizer execution.
```
cd visualizer
java -jar visualizer.jar -m ../generator/sample.mesh -o sample.svg -X
```

To vizualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - If need be: Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

### With Make (Has scenarios)

A makefile has been provided to easily create meshes according to their default types (however, this can be adjusted accordingly). 

* To create a regular square mesh: 
  * `make run`

* For debug mode with a regular square mesh: 
  * `make run-square-debug`

The following commands can add -debug to the end of the command-name to activate debug mode (i.e `make run-hex-debug` in the case of a hex mesh).

* To create an irregular unrelaxed mesh: 
  * `make run-irregular`

* To create an irregular relaxed mesh: 
  * `make run-irregular-relaxed`

* To create a regular hexagon mesh: 
  * `make run-hex`

* To create a regular diamond mesh: 
  * `make run-diamond`
  
### Generator Customization

If you wish to customize the generation of a mesh, such as the relaxation level and number of polygons, simply add an argument to the generator portion of execution.

```
cd generator
java -jar generator.jar -m *TYPE_OF_MESH* -r *RELAXATION_LEVEL* -p *NUM_OF_POLYGONS* -o *OUTPUT_NAME*.mesh
```

These can be written in any order and if you choose to omit any arguments, default values will be provided. Please note for regular meshes, relaxation level and number of polygons will be ignored.

Need help? Simply use `-h` or `-help` within the generator execution or run `make help`.

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.
